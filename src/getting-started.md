# Getting Started

Level: <i>Avid Ant</i>

Hello there and welcome to VI!

<strong>Goal:</strong> The newbie will have a basic understanding of our Manifesto, Biotope and will know the first steps of his Roadmap.

## Preparation

In your first chapter you'll learn about our Developer-Manifesto, the history and vision of Biotope and you'll setup the first steps of your Roadmap with your mentor!

Welcome to Virtual Identity, i'll be your guide.

## Our Vision

New developers are enthusiastic to work with biotope right from the start -
we share our experience so they can quickly make progress
and become an active part of the community,
giving them an easy start with a sense of achievement,
so that they are able to easily carry out projects with biotope
and to participate in improving biotope itself.


Please keep in mind: This vision and all resulting actions should be kept aligned to the overall Biotope Vision
We imagine three pillars:

- Enabling
- Sharing
- Mentoring

Some examples to illustrate what we could actually implement

## Roadmap
This roadmap gives you an overview and orientation of all the topics and challenges that you are going to pass the next few weeks at VI.

### Goal
> Every new frontend developer is able to implement components in our Biotope projects, in compliance with our VI standards!

Which includes
- knowing our common standards and
- having mastered the technical basics

This roadmap and all tasks should be kept aligned to the overall Biotope Vision and updated accordingly.

Please keep in mind: This roadmap will allways be work in progress. We want this to be a living document.
Duration: more or less 13 weeks (= 3 months)

During your onboarding you should always keep the following topics in mind and try to implement them in your work:

- Values of the Manifesto
- Best Practices
- Browser Support
- Clean Code
- QA
- JIRA Workflow
- Agile

<roadmap-component>

### Preparation

You will be assigned a mentor and also buddies for each lesson.
You have to organize your accounts and tools and afterwards this roadmap will be adjust to your individual skills. Beside that you will also get an introduction to the development manifesto.

*Goal: you can start right away and know where you are heading without being over- or underchallenged*

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Getting started

The first part of your journey is to get an overview of the topics, that come across during your first weeks. You will learn which vision the onboarding process follows and get in touch with our toolset.

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Fundamentals I
In that first part of the fundamentals of frontend development, you will be shown how to handle the mobile first approach, html semantics and css. Besides that you will learn about multiple frontend related topics such as WAI-Aria or SVG Icons. Don't be afraid, if you do not have any experience with them. We'll figure it out together.

__Challenges__
- Page Layout
- Content Structure and Webfonts
- Navigation
- Responsive Webdesign
- SVG Icons

*Goal: you know how to create a modern static web page*

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Fundamentals II
The second part of fundamentals of frontend development will take you into the css preprocessor world with SASS / SCSS and also bring you to frontend developers magic potion: JavaScript

__Challenges__
- Get your Workstation ready with node/npm and the taskrunner gulp
- SCSS 
- JavaScript (ES6 and beyond)
- Events

*Goal: you understand why we value components as building blocks of our frontends and you are able to implement interactive and animated components that can communicate with each other*

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Biotope - Basic Component
Biotope is the VI default Frontend Ecosystem, which is implemented in every project of VI. You will be shown how biotope works and which architecture relies to it and how you can build simple components.

__Challenges__
- Biotope playground
- Build a simple component
- Introduction to Biotope element
- Paths
- Biotope Resource Loader
- Build an accordion

*Goal: you understand how Biotope helps us to build scalable and reusable frontend frameworks and you are able to implement a simple component in a typical Biotope project*

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Biotope - Advanced Component
You will dive deeper into the functionalities of webcomponents and also typescript ( a typebased javascript language ). You will also be shown how to handle APIs correctly with the fetch API.

__Challenges__
- Extend the accordion with typescript and API requests

*Goal: you know advanced coding techniques to build more complex components and how to improve code quality through types and unit tests*

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Testing
In that topic you'll dive deeper into unit testing via different tools and learn more about the TDD approach.

__Challenges__
- Build some unit tests with jest, mocha and chai

</roadmap-component>

<roadmap-component>

### Biotope Ecosystem
You will be shown the whole ecosystem of biotope and afterwards you be able to work on biotope and bring it to the next levels.

__Challenges__
- Resolve an issue

*Goal: you gain insights into how the Biotope building blocks cooperate with each other to create a Biotope and learn how to improve them.*

## Tools

Your Buddy ensures that all necessary accounts are setup, the day you start at VI, this includes:

- Jira/Bitbucket (SSO)
- Confluence
- WPS
- Email
- Adminaccount
- Teambox
- Chrome/FF
- if mac → Windows VM
- Teams


You have freedom in choosing an IDE. We recommend Visual Code but if you prefer another one, we'll provide a licence.

Please discuss with the buddy.

The following software is available if the new developer needs them.
Usually images and vector graphics are provided by designers so not everyone needs these tools.

- Sketch
- Adobe CC

## The Boy Scout Rule

The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule (and I'm sure this also applies to the the Girl Scouts of America):

> Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

So if you happen to stumble across some instructions you find hard to understand or see some misleading texts littering around in here please be so kind as to power up your editor, make your adjustments, file a pull request and help make this page a better one. The next frontend developer to come along after you will definitely appreciate your contribution. 

__So please remember this simple rule and leave this page better than you found it.__

_Oh... by the way, this also applies to the code in our projects. If you come across some code smell take a little time and clean it up. It doesn't require you to make everything perfect at once - just improve the code a bit every time you come along. Thanks a lot :)_
