# Biotope: Advanced Components
Level: *Labour-saving Ladybug*

## Prerequisites
- A suitable working component with some kind of state and more than one element in it e.g. an accordion.
- Confidence in writing Code

## Subject Areas
1. **Typescript**: Rewrite your components in typescript. Write Interfaces where needed and think about edgecases. Don't care about IE11! Make it as awesome and future proof as possible.
2. **Data handling**:
    - Filter array
    - Find in array
    - Sort array
    - Map array
    - Reduce
3. **APIs**: Handle API Calls over HTTP
    - Fetch data from a real API

## Challenge
Rewrite your Accordion or, if you want a challenge, a useful component using an [open API](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). You need to tackle the above mentioned *subject areas*, so typescript is a must, as are data handling and an API.


## Questions
1. Why are we using TS?
2. Immutable vs. Mutable?
3. When should i use a mutable data structure?
4. Can you write your own filter functions using reduce?
5. How do you use a spread operator and what is it good for?
6. What is a HTTP status code?
7. Do we have alternatives to REST?
8. What is REST? What describes it best?
9. Do we have alternatives to HTTP1.1
10. How does a HTTP request work?
11. How does a file upload work?
