# Code Challenge

At Virtual Identity we are convinced about the Web Components standard. Therefore we use it in our daily work to build platform independent frontend ecosystems.
Your challenge will be to build a component in our Component Library Template based on Stencil.

## Timebox
Please take one working day (8h) time for this challenge. 

## Preparations
- Clone our Component Library Template https://github.com/virtualidentityag/component-library-template
- Check the stencil web page and get familiar with it https://stenciljs.com/
- If not existing already, make sure to have NodeJS installed on your computer

### Hints
- We use Storybook to display the components we build. Having a look at the page might help https://storybook.js.org/ 
- In our Component Library Template you will find an example component. That would be a good starting point. 

## The Challenge
Implement the following Component. Sadly our Designers forgot about the mobile design. Get creative and implement a responsive solution that works on all viewport sizes.

### Hints
- The headline with the red bar also belongs to the component
- Use a font you like. 
- There are no measurements for this Screen
  - Try to measure by eye. It will not be evaluated if it is a pixel match
- Use an own asset or mock image as you like
- The content next to the image is always vertical centered 
- The whole component has full page width

Good luck and have fun!
