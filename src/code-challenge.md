# Code Challenge

At Virtual Identity we are convinced about the Web Components standard. Therefore we use it in our daily work to build platform independent frontend ecosystems. We have a high quality standard for our work and therefore take SEO and Accessibility seriously. We also want to ensure that our code quality is maintaining a high level by using automated testing.
Your challenge will be to build a component in our Component Library Template based on Stencil. 

## Timebox
Please take (max) one working day (8h) time for this challenge.


## Preparations
- Clone our Component [Library Template](https://github.com/virtualidentityag/component-library-template)
- Check the [stencil web page](https://stenciljs.com/) and get familiar with it

### Hints
- We use Storybook to display the components we build. Having a look at their [Page](https://storybook.js.org/ ) might help 
- In our Component Library Template you will find an example component. That would be a good starting point. 

## The Challenge
Implement the following call to action Component. Sadly our Designers forgot about the mobile design. Get creative and implement a responsive solution that works on all viewport sizes.

Good luck and have fun!
